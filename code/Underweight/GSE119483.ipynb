      "!Series_title\t\"Identification of circulating protein biomarkers for pancreatic cancer cachexia\"\n",
      "!Series_summary\t\"Over 80% of patients with pancreatic ductal adenocarcinoma (PDAC) suffer from cachexia, characterized by severe muscle and fat loss and yet, there are no biomarkers identified for this debilitating condition. Our objective was to identify circulating protein biomarkers using serum for human PDAC cachexia and understand their biological functions. Serum from 30 patients with PDAC was collected and protein profiles were generated using SOMAscan. The protein profiles were correlated with clinical variables such as Cancer associated weight loss (CAWL), body composition measurements of skeletal muscle index (SMI), skeletal muscle density (SMD), total adipose index (TAI) using Spearmanâ€™s correlation. Overall, 110 proteins of 1294 correlated with these clinical measures - 47 proteins for CAWL, 19 for SMI, 14 for SMD, and 30 for TAI (r-value 0.5, p<0.05). LYVE1, a homolog of CD44 implicated in tumor metastasis, was the top CAWL-associated protein (r= 0.67, p=0.0001). Protein co-expression network analysis identified immune system related pathways such as B-cell signaling, natural killer cell signaling, IL6 signaling in addition to identifying other known pathways in cachexia. Taken together, these data identify both immune system molecules and additional secreted factors and pathways not previously associated with PDAC and confirm the activation of previously identified pathways.\"\n",
