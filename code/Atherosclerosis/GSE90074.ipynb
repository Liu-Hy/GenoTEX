A total of 143 subjects were used in this analysis. Briefly, five hundred nanograms of total RNA were used for gene expression profiling following reverse transcription and T-7 polymerase-mediated amplification/labeling with Cyanine-5 CTP. Labeled subject cRNA was co-hybridized to Agilent G4112F Whole Human Genome 4x44K oligonucleotide arrays with equimolar amounts of Cyanine-3 labeled UHRR. Slides were hybridized, washed, and scanned on an Axon 4000b microarray scanner.
