Healthy male controls used were age-matched to the T2DM group patients with mean(SD) 37.3 (7.1) years. Subjects with T1DM were younger [23.3(1.6) years]. Expression was compared and validated using quantitative real-time PCR. Statistical testing (ANOVA, P-value <0.05) was performed and fold changes with respect to the control were calculated\"\n",
      "!Series_summary\t\"Systolic BP, fasting glucose, HbA1c, total cholesterol and LDL-cholesterol levels were significantly higher in T2DM subjects compared with controls (P-value <0.05). Compared with controls, we identified 37 differentially regulated miRNAs in DM subjects. Among them, 21 miRNAs were upregulated (2-5 fold change, p-value < 0.05) and 16 miRNAs were downregulated (1.5-2 fold change, p-value < 0.05). These miRNAs had gene putative targets primarily involved in regulating pancreatic development and functions, adipocyte differentiation, insulin signaling and glucose-dependent insulin secretion.\"\n",
