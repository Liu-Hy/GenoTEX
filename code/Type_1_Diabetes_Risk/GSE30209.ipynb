      "!Series_overall_design\t\"58 peripheral blood RNA samples from 4 autoantibody-positive children and their matched controls were analyzed with Illumina Sentrix WG-6 v2 genome-wide arrays, in order to study the gene expression changes occuring during the pathogenesis of Type 1 diabetes (T1D). Each case child (positive for T1D-specific autoantibodies) was matched with a persistently autoantibody-negative control child, with the same HLA-DQB1 risk category, gender, and place and date of birth. Seroconversion is determined as the first detection of T1D-specific autoantibody/autoantibodies (ICA titre >4 JDFU, IAA >3.47 RU, GADA >5.4 RU, IA-2A >0.43 RU, ZnT8A >0.61 RU).\"\n",
