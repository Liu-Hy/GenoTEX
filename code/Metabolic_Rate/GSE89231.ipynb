      "!Series_title\t\"Doxorubicin response in diffuse large B-cell lymphoma cell lines varies with concentration, exposure duration, and level of intrinsic sensitivity\"\n",
      "!Series_summary\t\"Although diffuse large B-cell lymphoma (DLBCL) is a very heterogeneous disease, patients are as standard treated with a combination of rituximab, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, vincristine, and prednisolone (R-CHOP). Since approximately 40% of patients die due to refractory disease or relapse, enhanced knowledge about drug response mechanisms is required to improve treatment outcome. Therefore, this study assesses parameters that possibly influence doxorubicin response. Doxorubicin-induced impact on the number of living cells was evaluated for four human DLBCL cell lines, illustrating differences in intrinsic sensitivity levels. Six cell lines were subjected to gene expression profiling upon exposure to two distinct drug concentrations (0.00061 μg/mL and 2.5 μg/mL) for 2, 12, and 48 hours. Variation in gene expression compared to baseline was determined with a mixed-effects model, and gene ontology enrichment analysis was performed using the webtools GOrilla and REVIGO. Only few genes were differentially expressed after short exposure and/or exposure to the low concentration, suggesting lack of drug efficacy under these conditions. In contrast, 12-hour exposure to the high concentration induced several changes. In sensitive cell lines, doxorubicin affected the expression of genes involved in ncRNA metabolism, DNA repair, and cell cycle process mechanisms. In resistant cell lines, the expression of genes implicated in metabolic processes were altered. Thus, we observed a differential response rate to doxorubicin in distinct DLBCL cell lines and demonstrated that doxorubicin-induced alterations in gene expression and resulting ontologies vary with drug concentration, exposure duration, and intrinsic sensitivity level.\"\n",
