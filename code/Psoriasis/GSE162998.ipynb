      "!Series_summary\t\"Phototherapy is an effective therapy and may induce remission of psoriasis.  Previous studies have established the action spectrum of clearance and that apoptosis is differentially induced in psoriasis plaques by clinically effective wavelengths of ultraviolet B (UVB).  The aim of this study was to investigate the molecular mechanisms regulating psoriasis plaque resolution by studying the transcriptomic response to clinically effective (311nm, narrow band) UVB compared to a clinically ineffective (290nm) wavelength.  We irradiated lesional psoriatic skin in vivo with a single 3 MED (minimal erythemal dose) of 311nm or 290nm wavelength of UVB and performed skin biopsies at 4h or 18h post irradiation and from un-irradiated lesional skin.  Forty-eight micro-dissected epidermal samples were analysed using the Illumina DASL array platform from 20 psoriatic patients.  Bioinformatic analysis identified differentially expressed genes (DEGs) associated with 311nm but not 290nm irradiation; these DEGs were subject to Ingenuity pathway and upstream regulator analysis.        The number of differentially regulated epidermal genes was greatest at 18h following UVB, after irradiation with clinically effective (311nm) UVB. The main pathways differentially affected by 311nm UVB only were apoptosis, necrosis, acute phase signalling, p53 signalling and chemotaxis. The greatest fold change observed was a 7.5 fold increase in expression of CDKN1A (WAF1/ p21), the p53 target gene, following irradiation with 311nm UVB but not 290nm (clinically ineffective UVB).  Acute phase, LXR and PTEN signalling, dendritic cell maturation, granulocyte adhesion and atherosclerotic pathways were also differentially regulated by 311nm compared to 290nm UVB.      This work provides insight into the molecular mechanisms regulating psoriatic remodelling in response to UV phototherapy, supports a key role for apoptosis and cell death in psoriasis plaque clearance, and identifies a number of novel therapeutic pathways.  Further studies may lead to development of potential biomarkers to assess which patients are more likely to respond to UVB.\"\n",
